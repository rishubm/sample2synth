# Sample2Synth

Sample2Synth is a tool that analyzes short audio samples and predicts synthesizer parameters to recreate similar sounds using a virtual analog synth engine.

## What is it for?
- Quickly reverse-engineer the sound design of short audio clips (e.g., single notes, synth stabs)
- Learn how to recreate sounds using subtractive synthesis
- Automate sound matching for music production or research
- Learning and fun

## How does it work?
1. **Audio Analysis:** Extracts features from an input audio file using signal processing.
2. **Machine Learning:** Uses trained models to predict synthesizer parameters (oscillator type, filter settings, envelope, etc.) from the features.
3. **Synthesis:** Generates new audio using the predicted parameters and a built-in virtual analog synthesizer.
4. **Comparison:** Optionally compares the original and synthesized audio for evaluation.

### Audio Analysis
The system uses digital signal processing to extract meaningful features from the input audio (using librosa, a popular python package for audio analysis). This includes pitch (fundamental frequency), spectral characteristics, envelope shapes, and other descriptors that capture the timbre and dynamics of the sound. These features are the input for the machine learning models.

### Machine Learning
Trained regression and classification models (using random forests) map the extracted audio features to synthesizer parameters. These parameters include oscillator type, filter cutoff and resonance, envelope settings (attack, decay, sustain, release), and more. The models are trained on a dataset of known audio samples and their corresponding synth settings, allowing the system to generalize to new, unseen sounds. A lot of these audio samples were randomly generated by the subtractive synth

### Synthesis
Using the predicted parameters, the built-in virtual analog synthesizer (the subtractive synth essentially) recreates the sound. The result audio file resembles the timbre and character of the input.
